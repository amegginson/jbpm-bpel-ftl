<h2>JBoss jBPM GPD Update Site Installation</h2>

<p>To install the designer you have to work your way through a number of very easy steps. 
The described installation process has been tested with the 3.1 
version of Eclipse. Start Eclipse and use the regular plugin installation mechanism : 
select 'Help->Software Updates->Find and Install...'</p>
<p>On the first page of the 'Install/Update' wizard, select 'Search for new features to install.' 
and press the 'Next' button. The action on the next page depends on the fact whether you 
have extracted the archive containing this readme.html file or wether you either did not extract 
the archive or are using the starters kit version.</p>

<h4>If you extracted the archive :</h4>
<p>On the next page, press the 'New Archived Site...' button. Navigate to the archive 
containing this file, select it and press the 'Open' button.</p>

<h4>If you did not extract the archive or if you are using the starters kit :</h4>

<p>On the next page, press the 'New Local Site...' button. Navigate to the folder containing 
this file, select it and press the 'Open' button.</p>

<p>After these differences the rest of the installation is again common to both cases.
Check the checkbox next to the newly created entry in the 'Sites to include in 
search' list and press the 'Next' button. One feature should appear, make sure you 
select the checkbox next to it and click 'Next' again. Accept the license agreement 
and push the 'Next' and then the 'Finish' button. Eclipse will now ask you whether 
or not to install the selected features. Push the 'Install All' button and conclude 
the installation by restarting Eclipse. 
</p>

<p>More documentation can be obtained using the usual Eclipse help mechanism. Select 
Help-&gt;Help Contents and navigate to the JBoss jBPM page.
