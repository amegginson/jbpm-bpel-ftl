<h1 id="obtainingthesources">Obtaining the sources</h1>
<p>There are 2 basic ways of obtaining the sources:
<ol>
  <li>Fetch HEAD or some tag of jbpm.3 from the repository.  In this case, 
    you get one fixed set of versions for all subprojects.  Typically all HEAD
    during development.
  </li>
  <li>Second option is still TODO.  This will be a script in which you will be able to 
    configure sub project tags.  For each project a separate CVS tag will be fetched.  
    The source structure will however be the same as if you would fetch the complete 
    jbpm.3 module.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1 id="projectstructure">Project structure</h1>

<p>Module <b><code>jbpm.3</code></b> contains several subprojects:
<ul>
  <li><code>bpel</code> : the WS-BPEL runtime engine.</li>
  <li><code>console</code> : the jBPM (currently only jPDL) console web application.</li>
  <li><code>designer/jpdl</code> : the graphical designer for jPDL</li>
  <li><code>enterprise/cmdlistener</code> : the command listener MDB</li>
  <li><code>enterprise/cmdservice</code> : the command service SLSB</li>
  <li><code>enterprise/ear</code> : the enterprise archive packaging</li>
  <li><code>identity</code> : the identity module storing users, roles and organisational data</li>
  <li><code>jboss/configuration</code> : configuration for and deployment to JBoss of jPDL</li>
  <li><code>jboss/db</code> : building the default hsqldb db with jPDL tables and the example</li>
  <li><code>jpdl/db</code> : jPDL SQL scripts generation</li>
  <li><code>jpdl/dist</code> : building the jPDL runtime and suite</li>
  <li><code>jpdl/examples</code> : the collection of example projects</li>
  <li><code>jpdl/jar</code> : the jPDL jar library</li>
  <li><code>jpdl/userguide</code> : the jPDL user guide</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Each project has got its own <code>build.xml</code> build file.  Apart from that,
there is a general <code>build.xml</code> that has overall clean and build targets.
</p>

<p>The build scripts are all by default fetching their jBPM dependencies in the source 
directory structure.  Module jbpm.3 in jbpm CVS is considered the root directory.
Default navigation for dependencies is done relative.
</p>

<p>
There are two types of projects: 
<ul>
  <li>Artifact projects that produce exactly 1 artifact (e.g. identity, jpdl/jar, jpdl/db, ...)</li>
  <li>Module projects that group a number of child projects (e.g. jpdl, jboss, enterprise)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The structure of the artifact projects is inspired by maven.  Yet still 
we think it is easier and more convenient for the jbpm developer community
to keep ant as the central build system.

<h1 id="properties">Properties</h1>

<p>Sub project build files include properties files in the following order:
<ol>
  <li><b><code>${user.home}/jbpm/build.properties</code></b> : This properties file 
    can be used to customize build properties for your environment.  Since this 
    is located outside of the source structure, it will survive CVS updates.
  </li>
  <li><b><code>build.properties</code></b> located in the specific subproject 
    directory.
  </li>
  <li><b><code>${jbpm.root}/build/build.properties</code></b> is located in this 
    directory and contains most of the default property values.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1 id="build.properties">build.properties</h1>

<p>Summarizing, <b><code>${jbpm.root}/build/build.properties</code></b> in this directory 
will specify all the default properties that can be overwritten in the other two 
properties files mentioned above.
</p>

<p>The general <b><code>build.properties</code></b> has 3 major sections:
<ul>
  <li>Homes: some targets have dependencies on (or produce) installed software.
    See inside the properties file (or use IDE search) for more details on which targets 
    actually use the home properties.
  </li>
  <li>jBPM dependency properties: A set of properties that define where jBPM 
    dependencies are resolved.  Both for inclusion in the classpath and in packaging 
    composite files.
  </li>
  <li>Third party dependencies: A set of third party library properties that reference 
    third party libs in the local repository.  The properties are structured in such a way 
    that the version can be easily updated.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Property <b><code>jbpm.root</code></b> should be specified before 
<b><code>${jbpm.root}/build/build.properties</code></b> is loaded.  It must reflect a 
relative reference to the jbpm.3 module root directory.
</p>

<p>Property <b><code>module.name</code></b> is optional.  It is used to define
properties <b><code>artifact.id</code></b> (as <code>jbpm-${module.name}</code>)
and <b><code>artifact.name</code></b> (as <code>jbpm-${module.name}.jar</code>).
</p>

<h1 id="thirdpartydependencies">Third party dependencies</h1>
<p>All third party dependencies are resolved from a local repository.  By default the 
location is <code>${user.home}/jbpm/repository</code>
</p>

<p>In this directory, <code>ant get.dependencies</code> will fetch the jbpm required 
libraries from the jboss repository and puts it in your local repository.
</p>

<p>The local repository is a subset of the remote repository.  The remote 
repository is <a href="http://repository.jboss.com">http://repository.jboss.com</a>
and can be accessed via http and an ordinary web browser.  
</p>

<p>The configuration properties for customizing the repository are specified in 
<a href="./build.properties">./build.properties</a> and can be overwritten in 
your <code>${user.home}/jbpm/build.properties</code>.  By default, the 
local repository will be <code>${user.home}/jbpm/repository</code>.
The property <code>'local.repository'</code> specifies the absolute path of 
your local repository and the <code>'lib.xxx.version'</code> property 
specifies the version for library xxx.
</p>

<h3>Adding a dependency to the repository</h3>
If you need to add a library dependency to jBPM, please proceed as follows

<ol>
  <li>
    Find the library in <a href="http://repository.jboss.com">http://repository.jboss.com</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Find 'EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (1/4): VERSIONS' in <a href="./build.properties">./build.properties</a> 
    and add the version dependency for your library.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find 'EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (2/4): REPOSITORY LOCATION PROPERTIES' in that same <a href="./build.properties">./build.properties</a> 
    and add the local and remote repository locations similarly as is done for the other libraries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find 'EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (3/4): BUILD CLASSPATH' in <a href="./base.project.build.xml">./base.project.build.xml</a> 
    and add the library to the default build classpath.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find 'EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (4/4): UPDATE LOCAL REPOSITORY' in <a href="./build.xml">./build.xml</a> 
    and add the library to the <code>'get.dependencies'</code> target.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>One other special third party dependency is <b><code>docbook-support</code></b>.  
<b><code>docbook-support</code></b> is a module from the jboss cvs repository that is only used in building 
the jPDL docs.  This is also required to build a distribution.  The target to get the docbook-support 
module from cvs and put it in the local repository is <b><code>get.docbook.support</code></b> in 
the build.xml file in this directory.
</p>

<p>For running the unit and coverage tests, <b><code>JUnit</code></b> and <b><code>Clover</code></b> need to 
be in the ant lib directory.  In order to get them there, it is sufficient to <a href="#thirdpartydependencies">get 
the thirdparty dependencies</a>, verify the ant.home property in <a href="./build.properties">build.properties</a> 
and run the target <b><code>install.ant.libs</code></b> in the build.xml in this directory.  That target will 
copy the junit and clover libs from the local repository to the ant lib directory.
</p>

<h1 id="versioning">Versioning</h1>
<p>Each top level module (e.g. console, enterprise, identity, jpdl, ...) has 
a version.
</p>

<p>The version of the artifacts that are being produced is defined in the 
<code>version.properties</code> file located in the module directory.
E.g. <code>jpdl/version.properties</code>
</p>

<p>
The version of the jbpm artifacts that is being used to build other jbpm 
artifacts is defined in the <code>build/build.properties</code>.  Section 
<code>JBPM ARTIFACT REFERENCES</code>
</p>

<h1 id="eclipse">Eclipse</h1>
<p>
To get the build path right in your eclipse environment, you 
need to set the <code>JBPM_REPO</code> class path variable to 
your local repository.
To set your classpath variable, navigate:  
'Window'-->'Preferences'-->'Java'-->'Build Path'-->'Classpath Variables'
</p>
<p>
You can import the jbpm.3 module as an eclipse project.
</p>
<p>
As an alternative, you can also import a subset of the directories 
in the jbpm.3 module as eclipse projects.
</p>

<h1 id="release">Release</h1>
<p>Please, refer to <a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JbpmReleaseGuide">the 
release guide in the wiki</a> for release instructions.
</p>

<!-- TODO verify the next piece
<h3>Publishing a jBPM artifact to the repository</h3>
To publish a jBPM artifact to the remote repository, use the target <code>'publish'</code>.
</p>

<p>
The publish target will only work if you have executed the '<code>checkout.jbpm.repository</code>'
once so that there is CVS information available in the jbpm part of the local 
repository.  Before the <code>publish</code> target is executed, the presence of the   
CVS information is verified and you get an appropriate error message.
</p>

<p>
Another requirement is that you have developer access to the jboss CVS repository and that you 
have configured your command line cvs client with the proper authentication information.
</p>
