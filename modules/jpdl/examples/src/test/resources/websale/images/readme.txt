this images file is only for enabling display of the process forms
in a plain web browser.

@see also the form.* in the websale.par example process

together with the facelets jsfc attribute (e.g. jsfc="h:inputText"),
the forms can be developed and validated before they are deployed 
into jBPM.  this should speed up development of complicated forms.

for simple forms, we will provide a creation wizard in the gpd and 
some simple form generation capabilities.
