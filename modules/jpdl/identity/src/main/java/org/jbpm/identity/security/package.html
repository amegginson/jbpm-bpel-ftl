adapts the identity model data to JAAS with an implementation 
of a LoginModule and a Policy.  The login module validates 
the user/password combination and associates a User (=Principal) 
with the Subject.  The policy uses the Permissions that are 
specified in the identity data (accessed by an IdentitySession)
to validate access.
