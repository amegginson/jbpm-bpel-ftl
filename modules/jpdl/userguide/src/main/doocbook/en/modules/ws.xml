    <title>Invoke jPDL Web Services</title>
    
    <para>There is a WS subproject in jPDL. The aim of this subproject is to enable
    the jPDL engine to be called as a web service. The current implementation enables
    you to start process instances from the definition and to provide the trigger
    to running instances to continue their execution. It is not (yet) very sophisticated
    but it can serve as a starting point from which you can start to implement more 
    advanced uses.
    </para>
    <para>Stay tuned as there is probably more to come with respect to web services.

    <section id="wsdeployment">
      <title>Deployment</title>
      <para>Currently, there is no deployable artefact included in the distribution.
      Luckily it is very simple to build it yourself. Checkout the jbpm.3 codebase from the 
      jbpm repository, navigate into the jpdl/ws subfolder and invoke ant to build it. You 
      will find the jbpm-jpdl-ws.war artefact in the target subfolder. With JBoss AS it is as
      simple as dropping this file in the deploy folder of your server instance. You will need
      to endorse some libraries if you are running Java 6. For more information look at 
      http://jbws.dyndns.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Install_JBossWS.

    <section id="wstest">
      <title>Testing the deployment</title>
      <para>Once the web services module is deployed correctly you can test it with a tool
      such as SoapUI. Import the generated WSDL, send some messages and see what happens.
