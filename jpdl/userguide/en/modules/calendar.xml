  <title>Business calendar</title>

  <para>This chapter describes the business calendar of jBPM. The business
  calendar knows about business hours and is used in calculation of due dates
  for tasks and timers.</para>

  <para>The business calendar is able to calculate a due date by adding a
  duration to or subtracting it from a base date. If the base date is ommited,
  the 'current' date is used.</para>

  <section id="duedate">
    <title>Duedate</title>

    <para>As mentioned the due date is composed of a duration and a base date.
    If this base date is ommitted, the duration is relative to the date (and
    time) at the moment of calculating the duedate. The format is:</para>

    <para><literal>duedate ::= [&lt;basedate&gt; +/-]
    &lt;duration&gt;</literal></para>

    <section id="duration">
      <title>Duration</title>

      <para>A duration is specified in absolute or in business hours. Let's
      look at the syntax:</para>

      <para><literal>duration ::= &lt;quantity&gt; [business]
      &lt;unit&gt;</literal></para>

      <para>Where <literal>&lt;quantity&gt;</literal> is a piece of text that
      is parsable with Double.parseDouble(quantity).
      <literal>&lt;unit&gt;</literal> is one of {second, seconds, minute,
      minutes, hour, hours, day, days, week, weeks, month, months, year,
      years}. And adding the optional indication <literal>business</literal>
      means that only business hours should be taken into account for this
      duration. Without the indication <literal>business</literal>, the
      duration will be interpreted as an absolute time period.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="baseDate">
      <title>Base date</title>

      <para>A duration is specified in absolute or in business hours. Let's
      look at the syntax:</para>

      <para><literal>basedate ::= &lt;EL&gt; +/-</literal></para>

      <para>Where <literal>&lt;EL&gt;</literal> is any JAVA Expression
      Language expression that resolves to a JAVA Date or Calendar object.
      Referencing variable of other object types, even a String in a date
      format like '2036-02-12', will throw a JbpmException</para>

      <para>NOTE: This basedate is supported on the duedate attributes of a
      plain timer, on the reminder of a task and the timer within a task. It
      is <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> supported on the repeat
      attributes of these elements.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="duedateExamples">
      <title>Examples</title>

      <para>The following examples of the usage are all possible</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;timer name="daysBeforeHoliday" duedate="5 business days"&gt;...&lt;/timer&gt;

&lt;timer name="pensionDate" duedate="#{dateOfBirth} + 65 years" &gt;...&lt;/timer&gt;

&lt;timer name="pensionReminder" duedate="#{dateOfPension} - 1 year" &gt;...&lt;/timer&gt;

&lt;timer name="fireWorks" duedate="#{chineseNewYear} repeat="1 year" &gt;...&lt;/timer&gt;

&lt;reminder name="hitBoss" duedate="#{payRaiseDay} + 3 days" repeat="1 week" /&gt;
</programlisting>

  <section id="calendarconfiguration">
    <title>Calendar configuration</title>

    <para>The file
    <literal>org/jbpm/calendar/jbpm.business.calendar.properties</literal>
    specifies what business hours are. The configuration file can be
    customized and a modified copy can be placed in the root of the
    classpath.</para>

    <para>This is the example business hour specification that is shipped by
    default in <literal>jbpm.business.calendar.properties</literal>:</para>
