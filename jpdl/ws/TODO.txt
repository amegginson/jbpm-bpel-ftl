Open issues, things that require clarification
----------------------------------------------

[Impl]
- How will jbpm be configured (jbpm.cfg.xml) ?
- Type safety of process variables that get passed as xs:any? Maybe typed header would be better?
- Security: For WS Username token profile should be leveraged, on the other end the Identiy management component?  

[Concept]
- Signaling just proceed without any verification
- Leverge the JBossWS record management for history view
