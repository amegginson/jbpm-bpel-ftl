<p>the core identity classes User, Membership and Group.  They form
a domain model for organisational information like users, groups and permissions.
The structure is like this:
</p>

<p><center><img src="identity.gif" /></center></p>

<p>So membership models the n-m relation between User and Group.  Property Group.type 
can be used to have different sets of groups.  E.g. Groups of type "hierarchy" could 
represent the hierarchical structure of the company in departments, business units and 
teams.  Groups also have a parent-child relation to model the relation between those 
hierarchical groups.  The name property in the Membership can indicate the role which 
a certain user fullfills in that group.  This is a notion that corresponds to a 
position in a company.  E.g. the manager of business unit A.    That is why also the 
membership can have permissions associated to it. (currently, the permissions are not 
used in jbpm)  
</p>

<p>Another group type example could be "security-role".  In which you define a set of 
Groups that correspond to security roles that are used in the webapp security.  Then 
you have to configure a security domain in your servlet container that checks for 
membership against this group type.  That is how it is done now in jBPM.
</p>

<p>In later versions (when business calendar becomes persistable), we might also 
include a link between Users and Groups on the one hand and business calendars on the 
other hand.  To model different time zones and different business hours in different 
parts of a global company.
